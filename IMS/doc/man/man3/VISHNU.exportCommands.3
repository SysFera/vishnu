.SH "NAME"

.BI "ret=VISHNU\&.exportCommands(string\ " "sessionKey" ", string\ " "oldSessionId" ", string\ " "filename" ", ExportOp\ " "options\ =\ ExportOp()" ");"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Exports all the VISHNU commands submitted during a completed session\&. This session must be in closed state\&. The output of this command is a file containing a shell script\&. For safety reasons, the commands having a password for parameter are not exported (for example the vishnu_connect and vishnu_change_password commands)\&. This means the shell script must be run after opening a session manually or by adding the vishnu_connect command to the script\&. The access to other user\*(Aqs sessions is only permitted to administrators\&.
