.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Initiates a copy of a file or directory from the location given by the src parameter to the location given by the dest parameter\&. The src parameter must be provided in the form \*(Aqmachine_id:path\*(Aq (the machine_id values can be obtained using the vishnu_list_machine command) or \*(Aqpath\*(Aq only if the file is on the local system\&. The dest parameter must be provided in a similar way\&. Note that one of the two locations at least must be a remote location, i\&.e\&. a local copy cannot be handled by this command\&. The command listFileTransfers can be used to check the status of the transfer after it is initiated, using the transfer id as the identifier\&.
